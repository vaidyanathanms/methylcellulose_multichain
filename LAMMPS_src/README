LAMMPS source codes for methylcellulose trajectory generation 

in.cgrun1 -- Minimization (only for single chain) and nve/limit + nvt
in.cgrun2 -- Small Langevin + Long NVT
in.cgrun3 -- Long NVT-1
in.cgrun4 -- Long NVT-2
in.pair* -- pair coefficient file(s)

The current version has a Nose-Hoover thermostat time constant of 100*dt for NVT simulations. 
In the paper a stronger coupling of 1.0 is utilized.
